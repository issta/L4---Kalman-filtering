\section{Introduction} 

% (fold)
\label{sec:introduction}  The task is to compute the coordinates and velocities of a moving vehicle.  The calculations were done with a constant velocity kinematic model.  Measurement values in the Excel document, \emph{Measurement.xls}, give us the position and speed of the vehicle measured in 2 second intervals.  Other values given are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[-]PSD (power spectral density) of the random acceleration: $0.01~\mathrm{m}^2\mathrm{s}^{−3}$
	\item[-]Standard deviation of measured coordinates (both components): $3~\mathrm{m}$
	\item[-]Standard deviation of measured abs. velocity: $0.5~\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$
	\item[-]Standard deviation of initial velocity (both components): $3~\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$
	\item[-]Standard deviation of initial coordinates (both components): $10~\mathrm{m}$
\end{itemize}
